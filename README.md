# Commando

This is a class project made by 4 students of the "design and development of videogames" degree from Terrassa (Catalonia/Spain). 
The objective of the project is to recreate the arcade game Commando the more accurately possible.


##Description

Commando is a shoot-em-up vertically scrolling arcade game released by Capcom in 1986. The player takes control of a soldier named Super Joe, who starts by being dropped off in a jungle by a helicopter, and has to fight his way out 
singlehandedly, fending off a massive assault of enemy soldiers and rescuing captives. Your weapons consist of a machine gun with unlimited shots and a limited supply of hand grenades that may be replenished by stealing from the enemy.
