# Commando (LEVEL 2)

This is a class project made by 4 students of the "design and development of videogames" degree from Terrassa (Catalonia/Spain). 
The objective of the project is to recreate the arcade game Commando the more accurately possible. Between all the groups most of the game will be
developed, but our group only covers the 2nd Area and its secret rooms.


##Description

Commando is a shoot-em-up vertically scrolling arcade game released by Capcom in 1986. The player takes control of a soldier named Super Joe, who starts by being dropped off in a jungle by a helicopter, and has to fight his way out 
singlehandedly, fending off a massive assault of enemy soldiers and rescuing captives. Your weapons consist of a machine gun with unlimited shots and a limited supply of hand grenades that may be replenished by stealing from the enemy.
